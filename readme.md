I have created a webpage that showcases my personal portfolio. In its 
rudimentary state, it contains information about myself, my current pursuits,
future endeavors, and invaluable skills I've gained throughout the years.

The navigation menu immediately draws the visitor to explore my portfolio
by clicking through the links and each section is appropriately named. I do have a
one-liner so that the page does not feel too bare. The portfolio link presents
a fork for the visitor: to view my coding journey through my Github repositories that
is a real-time archive of projects or to view my past graphic design projects.

The contact page has simulated forms in which a visitor can choose to leave a message
or contact me via my provided email.

For consistency, the navigation menu is on every page and subpage. On the backend side,
I put each respective in its own HTML file instead of one continuous HTML file 
that would house each section.
